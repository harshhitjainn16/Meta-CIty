## Handling Questions

### "How do you prevent voting manipulation?"

> "Token-weighted voting means you need significant stake to influence. Plus, we have quorum requirements and time delays for execution. Early governance can add more protection mechanisms."

### "What's the business model?"

> "Transaction fees on building trades, treasury investment returns, and potential partnerships with real sustainability projects. This demo focuses on core mechanics."

### "How does this compare to traditional city builders?"

> "Traditional games: centralized, no ownership. MetaCity: democratic decisions, real asset ownership, transparent economy, actual rewards."

### "Why blockchain?"

> "True ownership of buildings, transparent governance, immutable voting records, programmable rewards, cross-game asset portability potential."

### "Can this scale?"

> "Absolutely. Monad is built for high performance and scalability. Smart contracts are modular and upgradeable. We can add additional chains for different cities as we grow."

### "What about sustainability claims?"

> "It's a game mechanic that teaches eco-friendly choices. Future: partner with real carbon offset projects, on-chain verification, real-world impact tracking."
